# mkvSplitter
Python script that uses ffmpeg and mkvtoolnix to split mkv into mp4 and extract the subtitles

It goes into the sub folders and it stores the filenames in an array, with full path, then starts processing.

At the end, in case there was any problems, it gives you a list of files it could not process.
